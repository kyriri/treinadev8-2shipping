# Shipping Adm
**â€” an application to manage shipping providers for an e-commerce**

:warning:  Project status: ongoing   

### Domain

This app intends to help manage the relationship between an e-commerce and its many shipping providers.

A **Shipping Company** is one such provider. It can be *in registration*, *suspended* or *active*. Only active companies participate in the quoting process, and for this they are required to provide their tables of **Shipping Rate**s and **Delivery Time**s, as well as a factor for calculation of cubic weight and their minimal fee.

**User** is the model managing access to the application. The role of *admin* is designed for an employee of the e-commerce who obtains quotes and distributes service orders, whereas the general case is designed for an employee of a shipping company who accepts or rejects orders on its behalf, and who provides updates for ongoing deliveries.

A **Package** is the information this app receives from another part of the e-commerce system. It is immediately tied to an **Service Order** after reception.

The **Service Order** is the main object of this app. Its status tracks its life: it starts as *unassigned*, changes to *pending* when a shipping company is offered the shipping service, and then changes to *accepted* or *rejected* according to the shipping company answer. Its end-of-life options are *canceled*, or, more happily, *delivered*. 

To help e-commerce employees (admins) on their task to choose a shipping company, they can run a **Quote**, which will retrieve prices and delivery times from all active companies for a given package. Each set of quotes is recorded and can be audited anytime.

When a shipping company accepts a service order, a **Delivery** is created, which records the **Stage**s of delivery, that is, the route of a package through the many **Outpost**s of a shipping company. This information can be accessed with a link by an unlogged person, and is intended to allow the costumers of the e-commerce to track their buys.
